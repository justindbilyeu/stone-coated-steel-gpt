Sustainability Profile of Stone-Coated Steel Roofing¹

Attribute	Data	Benefit for Texas homeowners
Recycled content	30–35 % post-consumer steel scrap	Diverts ~1.1 tons CO₂-eq vs virgin steel per roof
End-of-life recyclability	100 % steel reclaimable	No landfill fees; local scrap yards pay ~$80/ton (2025)
Longevity	50+ yr service life	Cuts material throughput; 2–3 asphalt tear-offs avoided
Cool-roof granules	Solar reflectance 0.30 avg (light colours 0.40)	HVAC kWh ↓ 12–20 % in Houston climate
Weight	1.4 lb/ft² (½ asphalt)	Reduced embodied energy in framing & transport

Embodied Energy vs. Asphalt²

        Steel 30
        Asphalt 45

Despite higher per-kg energy, lighter weight and long life make steel 33 % lower MJ/ft² over 50 years.

Landfill Diversion Impact³

Texas sends ~1.2 M tons of torn-off shingles to landfills annually. One 30-square metal reroof prevents ~6 000 lb of asphalt debris.

LEED & Energy Code Credits
	•	LEED v4: counts toward MRc1 (Building Life-Cycle Impact Reduction) and MRc2 (BPDO—Recycled Content).
	•	IECC 2021: High-albedo stone-coated panels (<0.30 SRI) qualify as a cool roof on ≥2:12 slope in Climate Zones 2–4 (80 % of Texas).
	•	Utility rebates: CenterPoint Energy Cool Roof program pays $0.28/ft² for roofs with ≥0.25 aged reflectance.

Carbon Payback Calculation

A 2 500 ft² Houston home switching to stone-coated steel vs architectural shingles:
	•	Embodied CO₂ saved: ~8 t CO₂-eq over 50 yr.
	•	Operational CO₂ saved via HVAC: ~0.6 t/yr ×50 yr = 30 t CO₂-eq.
	•	Net lifecycle reduction: ≈38 t CO₂-eq—roughly the annual emissions of four average U.S. households.
