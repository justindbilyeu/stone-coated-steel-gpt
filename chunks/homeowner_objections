Common Homeowner Objections & Data‑Driven Responses¹

Use the “ACK” framework—Acknowledge, Clarify, Kill the myth—to convert concerns into confidence.

Objection	Clarify / Data Point	Quick Rebuttal
“Too expensive up front.”	Installed cost $10–13/ft² vs. $4–5 for shingles, but steel lasts 50+ yrs.	“One steel roof outlives two asphalt roofs and cuts hail premiums 15–35 %. Net cost per year is equal by year 18.”
“Metal roofs are noisy in rain.”	Lab test (ASTM E90) shows stone‑coated panel + deck = 52 dB vs. 46 dB for asphalt—difference imperceptible.²	“Stone granules and attic insulation absorb sound; you won’t hear a drum effect.”
“Will it dent or chip?”	UL 2218 Class 4 impact: withstands 2″ hail with <3 % granule loss. Cosmetic‑only dents not covered but roof stays watertight.	“Your current shingle roof would need full replacement after that same hail; steel keeps protecting.”
“Lightning magnet?”	NFPA 780: metal roofs do not attract lightning; if struck, fire risk is lower because surface is non‑combustible.	“A metal roof actually dissipates energy safer than wood shingles.”
“Too heavy for my framing.”	Stone‑coated = 1.4 lb/ft²; asphalt ≈ 2.8 lb/ft²; clay tile 8‑10 lb/ft².	“It’s half the weight of shingles—no structural upgrade needed.”

Visual Aid: Lifetime Cost Curve³

graph LR
    A(Year 0) -->|$18k| B[Steel]
    A -->|$8k| C[Shingle]
    C -->|$9k replace| D[Shingle 2 (Yr 20)]
    D -->|$9k replace| E[Shingle 3 (Yr 40)]
    B -->|$0| F(Steel maintained)

By year 40, homeowner has paid $26k for shingles vs. $18k for one steel roof.

Incentive Reminders
	•	Class 4 credit: save $250‑400/yr in hail alley.
	•	Energy reduction: 12‑20 % lower cooling costs = $150‑300/yr (Houston model home).
	•	Eco angle: 100 % recyclable vs. 11 million tons of shingles land‑filled each year.
