Ridge Vent Integration for Stone‑Coated Panels¹

A ridge vent must exhaust hot attic air without exposing cut steel edges or compromising wind resistance. Most manufacturers supply a vented ridge cap system that matches the panel profile.

Vent Capacity
	•	IRC 2021 requires 1 ft² NFA / 300 ft² attic floor with balanced intake/outflow.
	•	Typical stone‑coated ridge vents provide 9–12 in² NFA per linear foot—meet code with 1 ft vent per 25–30 ft² attic area.²

Materials

Component	Spec	Note
Ridge vent core	Extruded HDPE baffle or non‑woven mesh	Ember‑resist option for WUI zones
Closure foam	Profile‑cut polyurethane	Blocks wind‑driven rain + insects
Cap screws	#10 SS w/ EPDM washer, 2”	Through vent + panel into ridge board

Installation Sequence³

1  Snap chalk line 3" each side of ridge.
2  Cut 1" vent slot each side; leave 6" uncut at hips.
3  Spray cut edges with zinc‑rich primer.
4  Lay profile‑vent roll over slot; tack every 24".
5  Seat stone‑coated ridge caps; fasten 18" o.c. into ridge board.
6  Install foam closures at cap ends; seal with butyl.

High‑Wind Adaptation (Zone 3)⁴
	•	Use low‑profile baffle vent rated to 110 mph (Miami‑Dade TAS 100(A)).
	•	Cap screw spacing tightened to 12″ o.c. in corner zones.
	•	Apply continuous bead of butyl under cap flanges.

Maintenance Tip

Inspect ridge annually; clear leaf buildup on mesh to maintain NFA. Touch‑up any exposed steel at end‑caps with manufacturer paint.

Sales Talking Point

“Stone‑coated systems keep the sleek ridge‑line look while providing code‑compliant ventilation—no plastic ‘mushroom’ vents breaking the roof silhouette.”
