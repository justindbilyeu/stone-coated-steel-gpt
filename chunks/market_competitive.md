        DECRA 50
        Westlake 50
        Tilcor 50

Key Differentiators
	•	Fastener visibility: Tilcor CF & TEK clip-lock hide screws—HOA-friendly for upscale subdivisions.
	•	Tile aesthetics: Westlake “Villa Tile” & Roser “Roman Tile” best match clay-tile curb appeal without weight.
	•	Local plant advantage: Westlake’s Cleburne, TX factory shaves 5–7 days lead-time vs West-coast shipping.
	•	Energy colours: DECRA “Granite Grey” and Tilcor CF “Antique Silver” achieve ≥0.30 aged solar reflectance (IECC cool-roof credit).

Price Benchmarks (Q2 2025, truckload)³

Brand	Panels $/ft² (stock colour)	Typical trim uplift
DECRA	$5.25	+16 %
Westlake	$5.05	+18 %
Tilcor CF	$5.45	+15 %
Roser	$4.90	+17 %
TEK	$5.60 (24-ga)	+20 %

Takeaway for reps: Lead with DECRA or Westlake for supply reliability; pitch Tilcor CF when customer wants hidden fasteners; position Roser as budget aesthetic upgrade over high-end shingles.
