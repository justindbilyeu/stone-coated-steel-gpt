UL 2218 Class 4 — Gold Standard for Hail Resistance¹

UL 2218 replicates hail strikes by dropping steel balls onto conditioned roofing samples. Class 4 is the most severe level and the benchmark for Texas insurance discounts.

Test Protocol

Class	Ball Ø	Drop height	Kinetic energy
1	1¼″	12 ft	9 ft‑lb
2	1½″	15 ft	14 ft‑lb
3	1¾″	17 ft	19 ft‑lb
4	2″	20 ft	23 ft‑lb
Two impacts on each of six target locations; panel passes if no splitting, fracturing, or delamination is visible from underside.

Stone‑Coated Steel Performance²
	•	Passes Class 4 on 26‑ga AZ‑50 substrate without substrate cracking.
	•	Granule loss <3 % mass; aesthetic-only dents permissible.
	•	High‑yield 24‑ga panels show even lower dent depth (<0.5 mm vs. 0.8 mm on 26‑ga).

Texas Hail Risk Map³

Region	Avg ≥1.5″ hail events / yr	Class 4 credit?
I‑35 Corridor (DFW → Austin)	3–4	Yes (20–35 %)
Panhandle	2–3	Yes (25 – 35 %)
Gulf Coast	<1	Optional (5–10 %)

Insurers must offer premium credits per Texas Insurance Code §2210; discounts apply only if ALL roof components are Class 4 rated and documented (Form PC068).

Field Data Highlights⁴
	•	2016 San Antonio hail: <8 % claim rate on stone‑coated vs. 67 % on asphalt.
	•	2023 Amarillo storm (2.75″ hail): All 14 inspected stone‑coated roofs remained watertight; minor cosmetic dents only.

Sales Talking Points
	•	“Class 4 = up to ⅓ off wind/hail premiums in North Texas.”
	•	Cosmetic‑damage waivers: Homeowner keeps coverage for leaks; cosmetic dents aren’t insured—emphasize longevity over aesthetics.
	•	Stone granules mask small dents better than painted standing‑seam panels.
