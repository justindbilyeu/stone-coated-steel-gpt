Finance Options & Payback for Texas Homeowners¹

Stone-coated steel’s higher upfront cost is often offset by energy + insurance savings. Use the figures below when quoting.

Typical Roof Loan Terms (Q2 2025)²

Term	APR (credit ≥680)	Payment per $10 000 borrowed
10-yr unsecured	6.9 %	$115 / mo
12-yr unsecured	7.4 %	$103 / mo
15-yr secured (HELOC)	6.1 %	$85 / mo

Rule of thumb: 30-square roof at $11/ft² ≈ $33 000 installed → ~$380 / mo (10-yr) or $280 / mo (15-yr).

Savings Offsets (Dallas 2 500 ft² home)³

Category	Annual $	Source
Hail & wind premium discount	$350	Class 4 credit (State Farm 2025)
Cooling energy reduction	$275	15 % kWh cut × $0.14 / kWh avg
Shingle tear-off avoided (year 20)	$14 000 / 20 ≈ $700 / yr	RSMeans reroof cost prorated
Total offset / yr	≈ $1 325	–

Break-even occurs ~year 17; thereafter steel roof nets $1 300+ / yr positive cashflow until next shingle replacement would occur.

Pitch Script

“Your monthly loan payment is about $300, but you’ll save roughly $110 / mo in premiums + energy, so your net cost is under $200. After year 17 the roof is effectively paying you back.”
