High-Wind Fastening (Zone 3 ≥150 mph)¹

Texas Gulf-Coast counties fall under TDI Windstorm Zone 3. Stone-coated steel panels must resist ≥-90 psf uplift (ASTM E1592). That requires upgraded screws, tighter patterns, and in some cases auxiliary clips.

Screw & Clip Options²

Component	Spec	Use case
#12-11 self-drill	316 SS, ¼″ hex, 1-½″	Direct-to-deck sheathing ≤¾″
#14-10 wood-binder	Class C HDG, 2″	Into rafters ≥1-½″ penetration
Hurricane clip	304 SS locking tab	Optional to achieve >-120 psf

All screws must include .945″ Ø EPDM-bonded washers for uplift + water seal.

Schedule by Roof Zone³

Roof zone (ASCE 7-22)	Screw spacing top flange	Stitch spacing (nose)	Edge clip req.?
Field	12″ o.c.	8″	No
Perimeter (10% roof dim.)	6″ o.c.	6″	If design ≥-110 psf
Corners (4% roof area)	4″ o.c.	4″	Yes (12″ o.c.)

Pull-Out & Shear
	•	Minimum withdrawal resistance: 250 lb (plywood) / 300 lb (rafter) per AC166.
	•	Torque target: 35-40 in-lb due to larger shank diameter.

Installation Best Practices⁴
	•	Drive screws into rafters wherever layout permits—engineered plans often mandate every 24″ rafter penetration.
	•	Pre-drill high-density screw rows in ridge & eave trim to avoid split decking.
	•	Add bead of butyl tape under first course at eave; acts as “starter” clip and blocks wind-driven rain.

Field QA Checklist

✓ Corner courses verified at 4″ pattern (photograph).
✓ Random pull-test >= 200 lb on 10% of screws.
✓ Clip count matches schedule; clips mounted flush (no shimming).

Talking Point for Homeowners

“Every panel edge in a Zone 3 install is locked down with stainless hardware rated to withstand Category 4 hurricane pressures—far stronger than nail-on shingle roofs that top out around 60 psf.”
