What Is Stone-Coated Steel Roofing?¹

Stone-coated steel roofing is a light-weight metal roof system that bonds durable stone granules to a 26- or 24-gauge steel core, delivering the look of traditional shingles, shakes, or tiles with the strength of steel. Panels interlock on all sides and are mechanically fastened to the deck, creating a watertight, wind-resistant shell.

Layer-by-Layer Composition²
	1.	Steel substrate – structural-quality sheet meeting ASTM A792 (AZ-50/AZ-55 Galvalume®) or ASTM A755 (pre-painted galvanized).
	2.	Metallic coating – 55 % Al-Zn alloy (Galvalume) or G-90 zinc for corrosion control.
	3.	Primer – epoxy/polyester film to promote adhesion.
	4.	Acrylic basecoat – thick, UV-stable binder that embeds the granules.
	5.	Ceramic-coated basalt granules – provide colour, texture, and extra UV protection.
	6.	Clear acrylic over-glaze – locks granules in place and sheds dirt.

Performance Snapshot³
	•	Impact: UL 2218 Class 4 (2 in hail).
	•	Wind: Passes ASTM D3161 Class F (110 mph) and tested to ≥180 mph with enhanced fastening.
	•	Fire: Classified Class A (non-combustible).
	•	Weight: ~1.2–1.5 lb/ft² — half the weight of architectural asphalt and <20 % of clay tile.
	•	Service life: 40–70 years with minimal maintenance.

Why It Fits Texas ⁴
	•	Survives large-hail events common to the I-35 “Hail Alley.”
	•	Approved in Texas Department of Insurance (TDI) windstorm zones up to 150+ mph.
	•	Qualifies for 15-35 % homeowner premium discounts when installed as a UL 2218 Class 4 roof.
	•	High solar reflectance granules cut cooling loads 12-20 % in major Texas cities.

Market Snapshot ⁵

Residential metal roofing (including stone-coated profiles) has grown from ~4 % to nearly 20 % of U.S. re-roof installations since 2000, driven by demand for durability in hail- and hurricane-prone states. Leading U.S. suppliers include DECRA®, Unified Steel™ (Westlake Royal), Tilcor®, and Roser®, but core construction is standardized industry-wide.
