Underlayment Rules for Texas Metal Roofs¹

Underlayment is the secondary weather barrier that must last as long as a 50‑year stone‑coated steel roof. Felt is obsolete in high‑heat markets; use synthetic or self‑adhered membranes.

Approved Materials

Type	Code Reference	Temp Rating	Typical Use
Synthetic woven PP/PE	ASTM D4869 Type IV	240 °F	Field across deck
High‑temp self‑adhered (S-A)	ASTM D1970	250 °F	Valleys, eaves, hips, penetrations; full‑deck in HVHZ
Butyl cap‑strip	ICC‑ES AC188	225 °F	Option for batten nail lines

Avoid #15/#30 felt—wrinkles at >140 °F attic temps and voids most steel warranties.

Wind‑Zone Installation Tables²

Zone	Basic wind speed	Perimeter requirement	Field requirement
Zone 1 (<120 mph)	Interior TX	1‑layer synthetic (4” horiz lap, 6” end lap)	Same
Zone 2 (130‑140 mph)	Central & North TX	S-A strip 36” at eaves + synthetic field	Synthetic field
Zone 3 (150 mph +)	Gulf Coast	Full‑deck high‑temp S-A	N/A

Fastening & Overlaps
	•	Plastic‑cap nails or screws at 6” o.c. on edges, 12” field (synthetic).
	•	Stagger end laps ≥36”; run underlayment shingle‑style upslope.
	•	On battens, drive nails through butyl cap strips to self‑seal.

Moisture & Vapor Notes³
	•	Synthetic perms ~0.5—allows deck drying; S‑A perms <0.1 (vapor block).
	•	For conditioned attics, combine synthetic underlayment with ridge/soffit ventilation (1:300 NFA).

Takeaways for Sales Teams
	•	Promote high‑temp synthetics as “50‑year underlayment”—aligns life cycle with steel panels.
	•	TDI inspectors in coastal counties will reject felt; full S‑A is mandatory for WPI‑8 certificate.
	•	Upgrade package adds ~$1.50/ft² material but saves re‑dry‑in labor after hurricanes.
