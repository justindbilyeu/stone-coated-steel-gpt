Stone Granules – What & Why¹

Stone‑coated panels rely on ceramic‑pigmented basalt granules to deliver colour, UV shielding, texture, and hail cushioning. Basalt’s 6–7 Mohs hardness resists abrasion better than slate or silica sand.

Granule Families

Type	Core	Pigment	Best‑fit use
Ceramic‑coated basalt	Crushed volcanic rock	Inorganic oxides fired @ 1 100 °C	90 % of TX supply (fade‑resistant).
Hematite blend	Basalt + iron ore	Natural iron oxide	Deep reds / terra‑cotta looks.
Reflective (IR) granules	Basalt + TiO₂ topcoat	Cool‑roof pigments	Low‑slope or energy‑code projects (≥0.28 solar refl.).

Adhesion Stack²

    A[Acrylic Basecoat\n(150–200 µm)] --> B[Granule Embed\n(Rainfall spreader)]
    B --> C[74‑m roller press]
    C --> D[Curing Oven\n450 °F / 90 s]
    D --> E[Clear Over‑glaze\n30–40 µm]

	•	Basecoat – water‑borne acrylic; tensile ≥250 psi, elongation ≥150 %.
	•	Embed depth – 40–60 % of granule diameter; too shallow → loss, too deep → colour blotch.
	•	Over‑glaze – UV‑blocking acrylic that locks loose chips and sheds dirt.

Durability Metrics³
	•	Granule retention: ≤2 g loss per 100 cm² after ASTM D4977 scrub (500 cycles).
	•	Colour fade: ≤5 ΔE after 3‑yr Florida exposure (Ceramic IR set).
	•	Impact: <5 % granule loss after UL 2218 Class 4 2″ steel‑ball strike.

Texas Stress Factors & Solutions⁴
	•	High UV & Heat – Ceramic pigments are inorganic, so they withstand 2 000+ MJ/m² annual irradiance without chalking.
	•	Hail – Granule cushion plus 26‑ga steel core absorbs energy; ensure panel passes Class 4 before claiming TDI discount.
	•	Humidity – Acrylic binders are thermoplastic; over‑glaze prevents moisture softening during Gulf‑coast summers.

Sales Talking Points
	•	Colour is baked in the rock, not painted—no peeling.
	•	50‑yr warranty typically covers excessive granule loss (<3 % in first 25 yr).
	•	IR granules can lower attic temps 8‑12 °F → 10‑15 % summer kWh savings.
