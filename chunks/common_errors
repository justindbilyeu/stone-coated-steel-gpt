Top 5 Installation Errors Seen in Texas¹

Each issue below is pulled from TDI windstorm inspections and manufacturer warranty claims.

#	Error	Consequence	Prevention
1	Under-fastening (missing screws, wrong pattern)	Panels lift in 90+ mph gusts; warranty void	Count screws per panel; photo-document corners/perimeters
2	Over-driven screws	EPDM washer splits → leaks, rust stains	Set clutch 25–30 in-lb; test first panel
3	Improper underlayment laps (uphill lap)	Capillary water entry; deck rot	Shingle-style: lower sheet always under upper; 4” / 6” laps
4	Mixed metals (copper pipe flashing touching steel)	Galvanic corrosion at contact point	Use compatible stainless or isolate with butyl tape
5	No allowance for thermal movement	Oil-canning, loud pops, fractured fasteners	Centre screws in slotted holes; leave ⅛” between trim pieces

Bonus: Walking Damage²

Stepping on high ridges dents panels & scuffs granules. Walk only in the lower pan over batten or deck support.

QC Checklist Before Final Payment³
	•	Random uplift pull-test ≥200 lb on 10 % of perimeter screws.
	•	Verify ridge/eave fastener spacing matches schedule.
	•	Confirm profile-foam closures installed at valleys & rakes.
	•	Check for exposed cut edges—prime & paint touch-up.
	•	Hose-test valleys and penetrations 5 min at 15 psi.

Homeowner Service Tip

If satellite installers need roof access, instruct them to use a ridge hook ladder or walk boards—never bare boots on panel ridges.
