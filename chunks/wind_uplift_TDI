Wind‑Uplift Essentials for Texas Windstorm Zones¹

The Texas Department of Insurance (TDI) issues Product Evaluations (RC‑series) that specify fastening schedules and design pressures required for a WPI‑8 certificate. Stone‑coated steel systems must pass lab tests and be installed per the evaluated assembly.

Lab Tests Referenced

Test	Purpose	Pass threshold
UL 580	Static uplift, positive/negative	Class 90 (≥‑90 psf)
UL 1897	Incremental vacuum pressure	# of cycles @ design pressure ×1.5
ASTM E1592	Cyclic load; large panels	Withstand 1.5 × design ⇒ no failure

Design Pressure Targets (psf)²

Zone (ASCE 7‑22)	Field	Perimeter	Corner
1 (<120 mph)	‑30	‑45	‑60
2 (130‑140 mph)	‑45	‑60	‑75
3 (≥150 mph Gulf)	‑60	‑90	‑120
Assemblies must meet or exceed the corner value to be accepted for the whole roof.			

Example: Tilcor RC‑523 Assemblies³

Assembly	Deck	Fasteners / panel	Rated (psf)
#1 Direct‑fix	15⁄32″ plywood	4 × #10 screws	‑75
#2 Direct‑fix (enhanced)	15⁄32″ plywood	7 × #12 screws	‑97.5
#4 Battens	2×2 battens + screws	8 screws + clips	‑135

Field Inspection Points⁴
	•	Screw size & count must match assembly (inspect 1 in 5 panels).
	•	Edge zones: verify 4″ o.c. screw pattern first 10′ from eave/rake.
	•	Upload photos to TDI portal before installing ridge caps—missing documentation is #1 reason for WPI‑8 denial.

Talking Points for Homeowners
	•	Direct‑fix enhanced schedule lets roofs ride out Cat‑4 (150 mph) gusts without batten voids.
	•	Achieving WPI‑8 may cut windstorm premiums 10‑15 % through TWIA credit tables.
