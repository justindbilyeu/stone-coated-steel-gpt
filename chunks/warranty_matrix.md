Fine-Print Highlights
	•	Cosmetic hail: All brands exclude dent-only damage; watertightness must be compromised for a claim.
	•	Finish fade: Coverage pro-rated after year 20 (DECRA/Westlake) or year 15 (Roser).
	•	Wind warranty validity: Requires installation per the evaluated fastener pattern (see [fasteners_standard] / [fasteners_high_wind]).
	•	Transfer forms: Must be filed within 60 days of home sale; missing the window voids remaining term.

Sales tip: Lead with DECRA or Westlake when buyers value one-time transfer; pitch Tilcor CF to investors flipping properties multiple times.
