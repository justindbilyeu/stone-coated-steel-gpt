Stone-Coated Steel vs. Asphalt Shingles¹

Below is a head-to-head summary focused on Texas residential re-roof projects.

Metric	Stone-Coated Steel	Architectural Asphalt
Service life	40-70 yr	15-30 yr
Hail rating	UL 2218 Class 4	Class 2-3 typical
Wind rating	≥180 mph with enhanced fastening	110-130 mph
Weight	1.2-1.5 lb/ft²	2.5-3.0 lb/ft²
Installed cost (TX 2025)	$9-13/ft²	$3-5/ft²
Insurance credit (Class 4)	15-35 %	0-5 %
Eco profile	100 % recyclable steel	Petroleum-based, landfill waste

Key Advantages for Texas²
	•	Hail & Wind Survivability – Class 4 impact rating and four-way interlock slash hail claims; panels stay on roofs in 150 + mph Gulf-coast gusts.
	•	Heat Reflection – Granule blends register 0.25-0.40 initial solar reflectance, cutting summer cooling loads 12-20 %.
	•	Longevity & ROI – One steel roof outlasts two to three asphalt replacements; lifecycle cost evens out after ~15 years.
	•	Premium Discounts – Texas insurers mandate Class 4 credits; typical homeowner saves $250-400 / yr on wind-hail portion.

Primary Drawbacks³
	•	Up-Front Spend – 2-3× higher initial cost; cash-flow conscious owners may balk despite long-term savings.
	•	Installer Skill Curve – Requires approved fastener pattern and flashing pieces; fewer crews are certified vs. shingles.
	•	Dent Visibility – Very large (>2.5″) hail can leave cosmetic dimples; cosmetic-damage exclusions often apply with insurance credits.

Talking-Point Takeaways
	•	Total-Cost Lens: When factoring two asphalt tear-offs + landfill fees, steel is cost-neutral by year 18.
	•	Weight Myth Busted: Steel panels are lighter than asphalt, so no structural upgrades needed.
	•	Wildfire & Lightning: Non-combustible surface equals Class A fire rating and safer lightning dissipation.
