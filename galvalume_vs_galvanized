Galvalume® vs. Galvanized Steel Coatings¹

Both coatings protect the thin-gauge steel core, but performance diverges sharply in hot, humid Texas climates.

Chemistry & Coating Weight

Spec	Composition	Typical roofing weight
Galvalume (ASTM A792)	55 % Al • 43.5 % Zn • 1.5 % Si	AZ-50 (0.50 oz/ft²/side)
Galvanized (ASTM A653)	≈100 % Zn	G-90 (0.90 oz/ft²/side)

Aluminium forms an inert barrier; zinc offers sacrificial protection.

Corrosion Endurance²
	•	Salt-spray (ASTM B117): AZ-50 shows red-rust after ~2,000 h vs. ~500 h for G-90.
	•	Field studies (Houston, 10 yr): Galvalume lost <5 µm coating; galvanized lost >25 µm and exhibited edge creep.

Heat & Finish Stability³
	•	Galvalume reflects ~60 % more IR, lowering panel temperature 15-25 °F.
	•	Aluminium component resists white rust chalking common on galvanized in humid summers.

Coastal Texas Caveat⁴

Within 1,500 ft of breaking surf, chloride attack accelerates pitting on both—but galvanic coupling in Galvalume can localise corrosion. Manufacturers often limit warranty there; specify pre-painted AZ-55 or aluminium panels instead.

Cost & Availability (Q2 2025)
	•	Galvalume AZ-50 26 ga = $4.80-5.50/ft² panels.
	•	Galvanized G-90 26 ga = $4.60-5.10/ft² but seldom stocked for stone-coated products.
	•	Cost delta <5 %, outweighed by lifespan gains—Galvalume now >90 % of TX inventory.

Bottom Line for Sales Teams
	•	Pitch Galvalume as the modern default: longer corrosion life, cooler roof temps, negligible price premium.
	•	Use Galvanized only for limited inland retrofits or when specified by project engineer.
	•	Near Gulf Coast, confirm manufacturer coastal warranty—may need upgraded coating or aluminium substrate.
