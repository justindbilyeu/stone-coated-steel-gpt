Steel Grades & Gauge Selection¹

Stone-coated panels use structural sheet steel that balances formability, impact toughness, and corrosion resistance. Texas installs overwhelmingly rely on ASTM A792 Galvalume® substrate; legacy galvanized (ASTM A653) is now rare.

Common Grade Labels

ASTM	Coating	Yield (min)	Typical use
A792 Grade 33 AZ-50	55 % Al-Zn, 0.50 oz/ft²/side	33 ksi	Standard residential
A792 Grade 50 AZ-55	55 % Al-Zn, 0.55 oz	50 ksi	High-wind / long spans
A653 SS Grade 50 G-90	0.90 oz zinc	50 ksi	Inland economy lines

*Galvalume lasts 2–4 × longer in accelerated salt-spray vs. G-90 galvanized.*²

Gauge Thickness Table³

Gauge	Thickness (in)	mm	Weight (lb/ft²)	Notes
24	0.0239	0.607	1.25	Coastal / 150 + mph wind belts
26	0.0179	0.455	0.94	Texas residential default
28	0.0149	0.378	0.78	Accessory flashings only
29	0.0135	0.343	0.71	Not approved for UL 2218 Class 4

Selection by Wind Zone⁴

flowchart LR
    A[Zone 1 <120 mph] -->|26 ga OK| B[Standard]
    A2[Zone 2 130-140 mph] -->|upgrade optional| B
    C[Zone 3 150 + mph] -->|require 24 ga or extra fasteners| D[Enhanced]

	•	Zone 3 (Texas Gulf Coast): many TDI evaluations stipulate 24-ga or 26-ga + intensified screw schedule to achieve ≥-90 psf uplift.
	•	Hail Alley (DFW–Austin): 26-ga AZ-50 already meets UL 2218 Class 4; gauge increase is not mandatory for impact alone.

Cut-Edge & Fastener Considerations
	•	Higher yield grades (50 ksi) can be prone to microscopic edge cracking when field-cut; always apply touch-up paint.
	•	Use Type 304/316 stainless screws in coastal counties to avoid dissimilar-metal corrosion where fasteners pierce the AZ coating.

Takeaways
	•	26-ga AZ-50 is the workhorse for Texas homes.
	•	24-ga adds ~30 % weight but delivers ~35 % higher moment capacity—ideal for >150 mph wind or large purlin spans.
	•	Verify gauge & grade on mill stamp before install; inspectors log this during TDI windstorm certification.
